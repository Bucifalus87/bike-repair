Your next assignment will be:
Come up with a viable concept, e.g. a small business idea. 
And the idea is a  Mobile Bike Repair Service
Create DTOs for it
Create the controller, service and repository layers
Create a producer and consumer
Persist the DTOs as entities in a database (your choice)
Make the commits nice and readable (one feature per commit or so)
 
The db and kafka can be spun up images (which I highly encourage)
