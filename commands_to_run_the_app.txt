after shutdown or restart I need to run the following commands. 
git bash

podman start bike_postgres: this starts the sql container
podman start zookeeper_bike_repair: this starts the zookeeper container
podman start kafka_bike_repair: this starts the kafka container
podman ps: to check if the container are running

also optional is to automate with a script:
create a script start_bike_repair_env.sh
navigate to project folder
open git bash inside that folder
type: 
nano start_bike_repair_env.sh
inside type:


#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting Mobile Bike Repair containers..."

podman start bike_postgres
podman start zookeeper_bike_repair
podman start kafka_bike_repair

echo "All containers started:"
podman ps

then pres ctrl+o, pres enter to save, pres ctrl+x to exit. 

make the start_bike_repair_env.sh executable
chmod +x start_bike_repair_env.sh




git bash
in the bike repair folder open git bash then run:
podman machine start: to start podman which does not auto start when the pc boots. 
./start_bike_repair_env.sh: this is the command to start the containers
